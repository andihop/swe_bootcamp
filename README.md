## How To Approach Coding Interviews
General Tips:
- Start with a brute force solution
- You'll want to analyze the time and space complexity, no matter how terrible it may be
- Improve your solution so that it is better by at least one complexity. Iterate, talk through improvements with the interviewer, and try to land on a solution that you are both happy with
- Make sure to use actual code, though pseudocode is good for planning out your approach
- Make sure to test your code _thoroughly_ before saying that you are satisfied with your solution.
